The error message "cannot pull with rebase: Your index contains 
uncommitted changes" means that Git detected changes in your working 
directory or staging area that haven't been committed. Git requires 
a clean working directory before performing a git pull --rebase to 
avoid conflicts between local changes and the changes from the remote.
